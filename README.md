# potential-sims
This repository contains all of the files and functions you'll need to get started simulating potentials with MATLAB's PDE toolbox. 
Take a look at TUTORIAL.pdf, it contains an extensive tutorial on how to use everything here.
If anything in the tutorial is unclear, needs updating, or if you have any other questions, feel free to email me at lscharrer@ucsb.edu
